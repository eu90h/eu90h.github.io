        <h3>[2021/02/20] McAfee ATR CTF 2021 Writeup</h3>
        <p>From February 5th to February 18th, 2021, McAfee's Advanced Threat Research team held a capture the flag
          (CTF) competition based on one held the year prior for its own employees. The challenges tested teams
          knowledge on topics ranging from recon, to cryptography, to rf hacking, and more. I had fun solving the
          challenges and learned a few things along the way. I decided to clean up the notes I had taken during the
          course of the competition and put them online in hopes they may be of later use. <a class="article-continue"

        <h3>[2017/04/08] More Than You Ever Wanted To Know About C++ String Layouts</h3>
        <p>While working on a reverse engineering project (a malware sample written in Objective-C++), I noticed a
          certain motif which always appeared whenever the program was dealing with C++'s std::string objects. The motif
          can be seen below. <a class="article-continue" href="cpp-strings.html">continue reading . . .</a></p>
