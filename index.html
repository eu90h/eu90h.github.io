		<h3>McAfee ATR CTF 2021 Writeup</h3>
		<p>From February 5th to February 18th, 2021, McAfee's Advanced Threat Research team held a capture the flag (CTF) competition based on one held the year prior for its own employees. The challenges tested teams knowledge on topics ranging from recon, to cryptography, to rf hacking, and more. I had fun solving the challenges and learned a few things along the way. I decided to clean up the notes I had taken during the course of the competition and put them online in hopes they may be of later use.</p>
