      <h3>Setting up g810-led udev rules on NixOS</h3>
      <section>
        <p>
          I have a Logitech g512 carbon keyboard and I wanted to control the LEDs on the keyboard.
          Thankfully there's <a href="">g810-led</a> which handles this for a number of similar Logitech keyboards.

          It's easy to install on NixOS, just add the g810-led package to your nix config. After it's installed, you can
          set up a profile which will be executed on startup creating the file /etc/g810-led/profile and adding
          <code>
            fx hwave all 2
          </code>
          for instance. You may have to create the /etc/g810-led directory if it doesn't exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, it'd be nice if we didn't have to run g810-led as root. This can be solved with the provided udev rules.
          Returning to your nix config, add
          <code>
            services.udev.packages = with pkgs; [ g810-led ];
          </code>
          and now you should be able to control the keyboard LEDs!
