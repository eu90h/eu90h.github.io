    <h3>Getting wgpu and winit to work on NixOs</h3>
    <section>
      <p>
        I've played around with graphics programming off and on for a while without ever getting too far (but always
        having fun!)
        The itch presented itself once again so off I went to scratch it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to give <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> a spin. I ran into issues trying to get the
        <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/tree/trunk/examples/src/hello_triangle">hello_triangle</a> example to
        work on NixOS and noticed that others also run into this issue, so I figured it'd be worth writing down.

        The first problem I encountered is illustrated below:
        <br />
        <code>
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os(OsError { line: 80, file:
"/home/stefan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/winit-0.29.11/src/platform_impl/linux/wayland/event_loop/mod.rs",
error: WaylandError(Connection(NoWaylandLib)) })
        </code>
        <br />
        After creating a nix-shell with the wayland build depenency then a second, related, error occurs:
        <br />
        <code>
thread 'main' panicked at
/home/stefan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/wgpu-core-0.19.0/src/instance.rs:521:39:
called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value
        </code>
        <br />
        Finally, we have another error:
        <br />
        <code>
thread 'main' panicked at
/home/stefan/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/winit-0.29.11/src/platform_impl/linux/wayland/seat/keyboard/mod.rs:315:41:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: XKBNotFound
        </code>
        <br />
      </p>
    </section>

        I was able to finally display the glorious triangle with the following nix-shell:
        <br />
        <code>
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
  pkgs.mkShell {
    nativeBuildInputs = with pkgs.buildPackages; [
      pkgs.wayland
      pkgs.libxkbcommon
      pkgs.libglvnd
    ];
    shellHook = ''
      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${pkgs.wayland}/lib:${pkgs.libxkbcommon}/lib:${pkgs.libglvnd}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    '';
  }
        </code>
        <br />
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        So why does this happen at all? Why do we need to do this? It seems like the problem is that some programs try
        to dynamically open a shared library (<a
          href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html">dlopen</a>), but can't find it on NixOS. We
        need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or use the <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf">patchelf</a> utility.
